Backend (Firebase): Secure data storage and real-time updates to manage course content.
Video Hosting (Vimeo): Reliable hosting for high-quality video content.
Quiz Program: An interactive tool for student assessments.
Key Features:

Landing Page: A welcoming entry point for users, offering an overview of the platform's educational offerings and benefits.

My Role:
As the developer of the Light Area eLearning Platform, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing the entire system. This encompassed both the frontend, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive user interface, and the backend, utilizing Firebase for secure data storage and real-time updates. Additionally, I integrated Vimeo for video hosting to ensure seamless access to high-quality course content.

Challenges Faced:
Integrating Vimeo for video hosting while maintaining data security and ensuring optimal video streaming was a notable challenge. Additionally, creating a seamless and secure app-only access for students required careful implementation. However, through the use of Firebase, Vimeo, and my web development skills, I successfully overcame these challenges to create a robust eLearning platform.
